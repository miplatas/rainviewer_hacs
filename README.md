A Home Assistant integration that detects storm conditions using **RainViewer** radar images and automatically publishes data to **MQTT**.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **IMPORTANT:** This integration is an informational tool and is **NOT** an official early warning safety device or a life-safety critical system. Precipitation data and estimated storm metrics rely on third-party radar imagery and automated heuristic calculations. Do not rely exclusively on this integration for personal safety, disaster preparedness, or severe weather emergencies. Always follow instructions and official warnings issued by your local government meteorological agencies and emergency services.

## ✨ Capabilities & Limitations

### ✅ What it CAN do:
* 📡 **Analyze Radar Tiles:** Fetch and process real-time radar imagery via the free RainViewer API (no API key required) using automated XYZ tile coordinates.
* 🧭 **Estimate Proximity & Direction:** Calculate storm cover percentage, core distance, direction (bearing), radial approach velocity, and render diagnostic proximity circles.
* 🗺️ **Generate Multi-Layer Visuals:** Produce static PNGs and animated GIF camera entities over Day, Night, or Satellite base maps with rolling buffer history and customizable timezone footers.
* 📊 **Expose Rich Entities:** Automatically create 14 state sensors, 4 binary sensors, and 3 cameras in Home Assistant without editing YAML files.
* ⚡ **Trigger Automations:** Automatically create state and binary sensors (rain, heavy rain, hail, approach status) to trigger Home Assistant automations and scripts.
* 📨 **Publish to MQTT:** Publish full diagnostic payloads (dBZ values, coverage percentages, proximity metrics) to local or remote MQTT brokers.
* 🔧 **Live UI Configuration:** Adjust scan intervals, thresholds, alert radiuses, and map settings via the UI for personalized use.

### ❌ What it CANNOT do:
* 📢 **Replace Official Weather Warnings:** Issue certified, legally recognized severe weather alerts or replace local emergency broadcasting systems.
* 🎯 **Guarantee Automated Accuracy Independently:** Sensor accuracy (such as `rain_detected` or `hail_detected`) is directly dependent on user-predefined triggers and thresholds (e.g., `Rain threshold`, `Hail threshold`, `Alert distance`) relative to the total analyzed radar tile coverage area and zoom level.
* ⏱️ **Guarantee Real-time Precision:** Account for third-party radar upload delays, radar beam shadowing, ground clutter, or scan frequency gaps inherent to public radar feeds.
* 🏠 **Predict Micro-scale Downpours:** Guarantee rain at an exact house roof level, as radar measures atmospheric reflectivity aloft, not ground-level rain gauges.
* 🌐 **Operate Offline:** Function without an active internet connection, as downloading radar frames and base map tiles requires online access.

## 🌍 XYZ Tile Format

This application utilizes the **XYZ tile format**, more commonly known as the **Slippy Map** coordinate system. It is the standard format used by OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, and most other web mapping platforms.

The structure of the URL always follows this pattern:
`.../{z}/{x}/{y}.png`

### Example: Northeast Mexico
**URL:** [https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/7/28/54.png](https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/7/28/54.png)

In this specific example (`7/28/54.png`), the coordinates break down as follows:

* **7 (z - Zoom Level):** The level of detail. Zoom level `0` shows the entire world on a single tile, while zoom level `7` shows a regional view (e.g., a country or large state).
* **28 (x - Column):** The horizontal coordinate. The grid starts at `0` at the western edge of the map (180° W) and increases moving East.
* **54 (y - Row):** The vertical coordinate. The grid starts at `0` at the northern edge of the map (85.0511° N) and increases moving South.

> [!TIP]
> Before completing your configuration, please verify that your specific `{z}/{x}/{y}` coordinates reflect the correct location by testing the URL `https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` in your browser for a given `x`, `y`, `z`.
